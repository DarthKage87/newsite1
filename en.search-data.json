Seeing the tremendous opportunity this technology represents, and the massive gap between the promise of the technology and the reality of putting it to work for business, our founding team set out to bridge the gap.\rDespite headwinds (scarcity of talent, of computer hardware for training and inference, cost scaling, and lack of a consensus approach to risk management for both the enterprise and societal impacts) venture investment in the technology sector and strategic investments at leading enterprises are starting to turn the promise of AI foundation models into an exciting new reality.\nfriendly productive robot Before these promising technical capabilities can turn into sustainable business value, much less herald the transformation of industry that is in the offing, they will have to be adapted to support the needs and processes of industry: reliability, transparency, and effecitve application to business processes. This is especially true for critical services in regulated industries.\nRational Exponent was founded to address this gap in the market by a team of bankers, technologists, and business innovators with a track record of successful startups turning technical invention into business innovation."},"title":"Company"},"/newsite1/contact/":{"data":{"":"\rCONTACT US\nUSA\rRational Exponent, Inc.\n2029 Okeechobe Blvd\nSte 1 #1208\nWest Palm Beach, FL 33409\nUK\rRational Exponent, Ltd\n1 Ashley Road\n3rd floor\nAltrincham, Cheshire\nWA14 2DT\nReach us by phone at +1-561-231-2652\nReach us by email at info@rationalexponent.com\nFor Media Inquiries, please contact re@msrcommunications.com"},"title":"Contact"},"/newsite1/industries/":{"data":{"":"BANKING FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATED INDUSTRIES"},"title":"Industries"},"/newsite1/resources/":{"data":{"":"","#":"ENTER NEWSROOM CONTENT HERE\rTHE BLOG WILL RESIDE HERE\rENTER THE WHITE PAPERS CONTENT HERE\rENTIER THE EVENTS CONTENT HERE\rEMAIL SUBSCRIPTION"},"title":"Resources"}}
